You were given a sample from PNAD Covid with 60,843 observations from August, 2020 and a dictionary spreadsheet explaning the included variables. Your end goal will be to estimate the causal effect of the emergency aid in scholar outcomes. Choose as outcomes _at least_ the school enrollment and last week days dedicated to school activities.

1.  Begin by cleaning and pre-processing your data. Drop rows and columns you deem needed, re-encode variables, impute (or drop) NA values, etc.

2. State a causal estimand of interest and the **assumptions** required for the identification of this effect on a selection-on-observables framework. Explain why you need to impose those assumptions.

3.  The Design Stage. Focus solely on the treatment indicator and covariates, do not use the outcome variable.

  > 3.1 Show the initial covariate's balance. At least one of these overlap measures should be provided: normalized difference, log-ratio of standard deviations or coverage. Are these covariates balanced between groups?
  
  > 3.2 Choose a subset of covariates to be part of your propensity score model. Justify the economic relevance of covariates included. Estimate a propensity score model and assess the overlap assumption. Comment on your results and how could you improve overlap? Also, specify a **linear regression** using those same covariates and estimate the causal effect, save the result for future comparisons.
  
  > 3.3 Based on the propensity score, split your sample into blocks, following the Imbens and Rubin's methodology you have seen in class. Reassess your chosen covariates' balance **within** each block. You can trim your sample to improve overlap.

4. Assess the Unconfoundedness assumption by choosing a placebo outcome and performing the causal effect estimation on this placebo. Choose one of the estimation methods: Subclassification, Matching on the PS, Matching on $X$ (Mahalanobis distance). If using matching, all control units are to be matched against a treated unit[^full]. (with different weights). Why is this a good placebo?    

[^full]: You may want to check this vignette, [MatchIt: Getting Started](http://www.maths.bristol.ac.uk/R/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/MatchIt.html)

5. With the trimmed sample, estimate the causal effect using **all** five methods: _Subclassification, Matching on the PS, Matching on $X$, linear regression, and Doubly-Robust_. Compare the results you have and the linear regression from item 2.2 (without trimming). Do you think you have a good causal model? Why? If not, explain what else would you do to recover the causal estimand.

6. **Bonus.** Estimate the causal effect through one of those *Machine Learning* methods: Generalized Random Forests [@Athey2019b] or Double Machine Learning [@Chernozhukov2018a]
